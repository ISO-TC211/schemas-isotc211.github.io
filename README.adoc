== Introduction

The ISO/TC 211 XML Schemas site is used to publish XML schemas published by
ISO/TC 211 standards.

This repository is used to build and deploy the https://schemas.isotc211.org
site.

This repository is jointly managed by ISO/TC 211 and operated by Ribose under
the ISO/TC 211 Harmonized Resources Maintenance Agency (HRMA) run by the Swedish
Institute of Standards (SIS).


== Building the site

Use the Makefile for building the site, which internally uses the `hrma` gem
given in the `schemas/` directory.

[source,sh]
----
# removes site artifacts
make clean

# builds schema documentation and builds _site
make all

# starts a local server
make serve
----


== Project Structure

* `schemas/` - Contains the ISO/TC 211 schema files and documentation generator
* `source/` - Contains the source files for the Jekyll site
* `build_source/` - Temporary build directory (generated)
* `_site/` - Final site output directory (generated)
* `Makefile` - Build system
* `.github/` - GitHub Actions workflows and configuration

== Documentation and tools

For more detailed documentation on the `hrma` tool and how to manage schemas,
see the README in the `schemas/` directory.

The `hrma` tool provides commands for:

* Managing the schema manifest file (`schemas.yml`)
* Generating documentation for schemas
* Cleaning up generated files

[source,sh]
----
# Show available commands
cd schemas && bundle exec hrma help

# Show help for a specific command
cd schemas && bundle exec hrma build help

# Generate schema documentation
cd schemas && bundle exec hrma build documentation

# Clean all generated files
cd schemas && bundle exec hrma build clean
